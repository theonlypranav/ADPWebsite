Our creations include one major structure (outside the main Audi), one front structure (in front of the Clock Tower), a secondary structure (outside the FD-2 building) and multiple photo-booths in different key spots on campus. In recent creations, welding has taken utmost prominence with there being significant improvements in the overall structural integrity.',
