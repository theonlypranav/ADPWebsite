      description: 'Structure, often referred to as the \'Muscle\' of ADP, deals with creating life-size (or even bigger) models with different elements like wood, metal rods, paper mache and much more. Our creations include one major structure (outside the main Audi), one front structure (in front of the Clock Tower), a secondary structure (outside the FD-2 building) and multiple photo-booths in different key spots on campus. In recent creations, welding has taken utmost prominence with there being significant improvements in the overall structural integrity.',
